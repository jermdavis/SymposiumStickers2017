# Stickers from the 2017 Sitecore Symposium and MVP Summit

Various people asked about getting more of the collection of silly stickers I had at Symposium this year.
Since everyone's spread across the globe, I figured it would be easiest to publish the artwork so that you can re-print them, or create your own variations.

The files are available in Photoshop format, and as PNGs below.
They're under an "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">attribution, share-alike</a>" license so if you've got customisations you'd like to make, go ahead.
Just give the artwork back to the community and link back to this repo.

For Symposium, I used <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/uk/custom-stickers">Sticker Mule</a> to print copies of these, and the quality was great.
It's a bit hidden, but they also have <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/samples/stickers">an "order samples" option</a>, which lets you get smaller numbers if you only need a few (or to check out your designs).
